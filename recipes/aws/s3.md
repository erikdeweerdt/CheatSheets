# AWS S3

## CORS settings for use with CloudFront
A correct CORS configuration for S3 looks like this:
```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "http://*",
            "https://*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
```
Take special note of the `AllowedOrigins`. Don't just specify `*` here, as that will break under certain conditions.

In the origin's behavior on CloudFront:
* "Cache and origin request settings" must be set to "Use legacy cache settings".
* "Cache Based on Selected Request Headers" must be set to "Whitelist".
* "Whitelist Headers" must include "Origin", "Access-Control-Request-Headers" and "Access-Control-Request-Method".
